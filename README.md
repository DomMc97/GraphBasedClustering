Multiscale graph-based clustering via Markov Stability
================
Zijing Liu

Introduction
------------
This contains the MATLAB codes for graph-based clustering via Markov Stability (https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~mpbara/Partition_Stability/).
For an illustration, have a look at the notebook [MarkovStabilityClustering.ipynb](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/GraphBasedClustering/blob/master/MarkovStabilityClustering.ipynb)
*  script_clustering_paper.m - the example file for running the framework, same as the notebook. 
*  test_graph_build.m - test different graph constructions.
*  othercompare.m - clustering using other methods.
*  matlab/ - Matlab codes for graph construction, Markov Stability and two spectral clustering methods.
*  Data/ - public and generated datasets.
